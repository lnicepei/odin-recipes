    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A very quick and easy fix to a tasty side-dish. Fancy, designer 
    mac and cheese often costs forty or fifty dollars to prepare </p>
        <p>when you have so many exotic and expensive cheeses, but they aren't
         always the best tasting. This recipe is cheap and tasty. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni </li>
        <li>¼ cup butter </li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups milk </li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in flour, salt, and pepper until smooth, about 5 minutes. Slowly pour milk into butter-flour mixture while continuously stirring until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Add Cheddar cheese to milk mixture and stir until cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
